# Dynamic Updates of Virtual PLCs: Experiment Data

## Overview
This repository provides experiment data from the ECSA 2021 paper "[Dynmic Updates of Virtual PLCs Deployed as Kubernetes Microservices"] (https://www.koziolek.de/docs/Koziolek2021-ECSA-preprint.pdf) written by Heiko Koziolek, Andreas Burger, P. P. Abdulla, Julius RÃ¼ckert, Shardul Sonar, Pablo Rodriguez from ABB Research. A 15-minute video presentation is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5J3Pj06ig).

* "Execution Times State Transfer - Different Number of Variables.xlsx": contains the state transfer times for different number of variables and was the source for Fig. 6 in the paper.
* "Execution Times State Transfer Steps - 100K variables.xlsx": contains a breakdown of different steps of the state transfer execution time for 100K variables and was the source for Fig. 7 in the paper.

The experiment setup and the used tools are described in the paper, referenced above.
